Learning Node.js by doing - this repo chronicles the process. This repo has some of the code samples of the course ¨[NodeJS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/) by Maximilian Schwarzmüller on Udemy which I recommend. This repo is not a course!

REPL

REPL stands for Read, Eval, Print and Loop.

To start using REPL just type `node` in the terminal and then execute some node commands like `console.log("Hello world")` or a simple operation like `2+2`

To exit REPL just `Ctrl + C`

## Structure of this project

There are several folders to organize the code:

### JavaScriptBasics

This folder contains very basic Javascripts files to practice simple scenario. No need to run servers or browser to test the code. Just node.
